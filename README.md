# grace-hopper-responsive-project
In this project I play with Responsive Layouts in HTML + CSS to build a page about Grace Hopper. I took a mobile-first approach to building this page so you might want to make your browser screen narrower, and then expand it to see the responsive layout.

This is a project from the codebar HTML + CSS tutorials.
